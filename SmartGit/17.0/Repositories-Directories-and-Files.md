# Repositories, Directories and Files

The Repositories view shows all repositories known to SmartGit and, for
repositories opened in this window, the directory structure (and their
states). The Files view displays the status of your working tree (and
Index). The primary directory states are listed in [Primary Directory States](#primary-directory-states), and
possible states of submodules in [Submodule States](#submodule-states). Every
primary and submodule state may be combined with additional states,
which are listed in [Additional Directory States](#additional-directory-states). The
possible file states are listed in [File States](#file-states).

## Repository Management

To add existing or new local repositories to SmartGit, please take a
look at the section [Repository-Related](Repository-Related.md).

## File Filtering

The **Files** view of the main window can be filtered by file state and
name. The state filters can be set using the small toolbar buttons above
the table as well as the menu items in the **View** menu. By default, if
committable files (e.g. *index-only changed* or *untracked*) are hidden,
the background turns to light-red as a reminder to not forget about
them. If this annoys you because you permanently have untracked files in
your working, you should consider to mark them as ignored. If this is no
option for you, you can deactivate this coloring feature in the
Preferences (page **User Interface**, option **Use background color for
the file table to indicate certain states**).

To filter by name, use the input field (or *\<Ctrl/Cmd>+\<F>*-keystroke)
above the file table. The context menu allows to enable regular
expressions and save patterns for later usage or delete them. Even if
unchanged files are hidden, they can be found by filtering by name - the
files matching by name but not by state are shown in gray, while a
light-yellow background indicates the name-filtering state.

## Fixing 'Modified (File Mode)' on Windows

On Windows, the *Modified (File Mode)* state is usually caused due to a
misconfiguration of your local repository, when not having
`core.filemode` configuration option explicitly set to `false` (the
default value is `true`).

Hence, if this option in not present in `.git/config` of your
repository, invoke `git config core.filemode false` in the root
directory of your repository to fix this problem.
