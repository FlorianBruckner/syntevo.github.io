# Git Windows

SmartGit comes with 3 different Git windows that all can execute Git commands:

- the **Working Tree window** focuses on a file-centric display of changes; it also shows the **Journal**, a tiny log for the latest commits of the current branch and from another branch (e.g. for cherry-picking),
- the **Log window** focuses on the commit graph history; local changes are displayed as a separate node attached to the HEAD;
- the **Standard window** focuses on easier (more limited) work-flows; it combines a file-centric **Local Files** and a graph-based **History** view of the repository

You can use all 3 different Git windows at the same time, but the default one you can configure in the preferences.
The default window is used, e.g. if you open a repository using the command line.
