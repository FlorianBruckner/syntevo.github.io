# Licensing

There exist two types of commercial licenses:
- [subscription licenses](Subscription-Licenses.md) and
- "single payment" (perpetual) licenses.

## Single-payment (perpetual) licenses
You can purchase 1, 2 or 3 years of updates.
This means you can use any SmartGit version which we release until the end of your ordered update period, as long as you like (even after the update period ended) on the operating system versions supported by these SmartGit versions.
After the update period you can [purchase upgrade licenses](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/purchase/#upgrade) for a reduced price by uploading your existing (newest) license file.

In the past there also were licenses available with lifetime updates.
These allowed to use any future version of SmartGit.

During the support period (90 days, 1, 2 or 3 years) you may contact our email support at [smartgit@syntevo.com](mailto:smartgit@syntevo.com).
