# Non-commercial licenses

For certain uses we are offering free non-commercial licenses.
These licenses are restricted in certain aspects:
- the Standard window is not supported
- self-hosted hosting providers are not supported
The Hobby license is even more restricted; it allows only
- repositories where you are the sole committer and
- open source repositories publicly available at github.com and bitbucket.org.
